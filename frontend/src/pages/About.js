                <p><strong>Hello! I'm Cedric Nagata, </strong> 
                    a Computer Science student nearing the completion of my academic journey at the Paul G. Allen 
                    School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. My enthusiasm 
                    lies in web development, data management, and machine learning, areas that blend 
                    creativity with logic in the most fascinating ways.</p>

            <div class="experience">
                <h3>Experience:</h3>
                <p>I had the privilege of interning at <strong>Tyler Technologies, Inc</strong> 
                    during the summers of 2022 and 2023. As a software engineering intern, I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created a search functionality using Elasticsearch and Form.io that
                        processes thousands of data entries from across the country
                    </li>
                    <li>Created a secure form sharing functionality using Python, Django Admin, 
                        and Form.io.
                    </li>
                    <li>Used Docker to create a local development environment for a large-scale project, 
                        creating connected images for Django, Form.io, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL 
                        within the container.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enhanced my Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS skills</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These experiences not only honed my technical skills but also provided a glimpse 
                    into the collaborative and innovative nature of the tech world.</p>

                <h3>Current Projects:</h3>
                <p>Currently, I am dedicating my time to a promising application that employs 
                    machine learning to aid individuals in identifying dermatological conditions 
                    through a simple smartphone snapshot. Itâ€™s a thrilling endeavor that aligns 
                    with my interest in utilizing technology to address real-world challenges. Visit
